# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

For this project we were tasked with preforming an analysis for a school district and remove the reading and math scores for the ninth grade students at Thomas High School as they have been altered.

## Results

### District Summary

- In the summary for the entire school district, editing the Thomas High School grades effected the average math score for the district by one tenth of a percent as we can see in the following images.

### Schools Summary

- As we can see in the images, all the categories for the scoring metrics for Thomas High School were effected by the change in the ninth grader's scores

### Performing Sumary

- Although Thomas High School's overall position didn't change, their "% Passing Reading" and "Average Math Scores" category was higher than Griffin High School before taking the ninth grade scores out. After the scores were removed Thomas High School fell below Griffin High School in those categories. We see this in the images below.

- The math and reading scores by grade only affected the ninth graders at Thomas High School. Because it removed all of the scores for the ninth graders, in the corrected analysis they show up as "not a number".

## Summary  

After removing the Thomas High School ninth grade students' math and reading socres and running the analysis again we saw some of the metrics were different. The categories that we saw changed were the total district average math scores, as well as the percent of students passing math, the percent of students passing reading and the overall percent of students passing for Thomas High School.
